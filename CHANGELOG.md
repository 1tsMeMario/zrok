# v0.3.0

The `v0.2` series was a _proof-of-concept_ implementation for the overall `zrok` architecture and the concept.

`v0.3` is a massive elaboration of the concept, pivoting it from being a simple ephemeral reverse proxy solution, to being the beginnings of a comprehensive sharing platform, complete with public and private sharing (built on top of OpenZiti). 

`v0.3.0` includes the minimal functionality required to produce an early, preview version of the elaborated `zrok` concept, suitable for both production use at `zrok.io`, and also suitable for private self-hosting.

From `v0.3.0` forward, we will begin tracking notable changes in this document.

# v0.2.18

* DEFECT: Token generation has been improved to use an alphabet consisting of `[a-zA-Z0-9]`. Service token generation continues to use a case-insensitive alphabet consisting of `[a-z0-9]` to be DNS-safe.
