# v0.3.0 (WiP)

## Frontend Selection; Private Shares

The `zrok` model has been extended to include support for both a "public share" (exposing a backend through the globally-available `frontend` instances), and also a "private share" (exposing a backend service to a user who instantiates a private, local `frontend`).

### Underlying Schema Changes



## Loop Test Shutdown Hook

The `zrok test loop` command now includes a shutdown hook to allow premature cancellation of a running test.
