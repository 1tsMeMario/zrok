# Downloads

Right now all `zrok` binaries are delivered from the release page at GitHub.

Head over to https://github.com/openziti/zrok/releases/latest to find the latest downloads.

You need the right download for your OS and CPU. This can be confusing because the OS, e.g., Raspberry Pi OS, could be 32bit even if you have a 64bit Pi (v3, 4, or Zero 2). Linux users can always find the right version by looking up the result of `uname -m` in this table.

| Result           |Linux Download Name |
