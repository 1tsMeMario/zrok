# v0.3 Public/Private Sharing

The `v0.3` series includes support for both "public" and "private" reverse proxies.

## Entities (SQL)

`v0.3` introduces a new `frontends` table to allow the `zrok` controller to track the frontend instances that are available to any account or environment.

The following illustration shows the possibilities available.

The `*.in.zrok.io` frontend is a "public" frontend, available to all `zrok` users. Most `zrok` installations will want to have at least one public, global frontend for all public, internet-facing ingress traffic for private backend instances. In the underlying data store, the public frontend will have a row in the `frontends` table with a `NULL` `environment_id`, and a `name` set to `public` (or some other representative name).

The other two "private" frontends are configured with an `environment_id` and no `name` label (the lack of a `name` label signifies that these are "private" frontends). The ephemeral environment is allocated when a `zrok` frontend request is made without an account on behalf of a private share.
