# Core Features

`zrok` was built for sharing resources. This doc is meant to explain the core features of `zrok` sharing
as well as other important features.

Sharing with `zrok` can be either [`public`](./sharing-public.md) or [`private`](./sharing-private.md).
Naturally, regular web-based resources can be shared but `zrok` also includes a [file sharing](./files.md) feature.

Learn about `zrok` [hosting here](./hosting.md).
