# Shares - Reserved

`zrok` was built to share and access digital resources. A `reserved` share allows the user to have a reliable,
public, persistent shared url. (the share name not ephemeral, it is `reserved`). This means that the share
will be able to be used and regardless of how many times the resource is shared. This is useful when the 
url must be known. 

Use the `zrok reserve` command to create a reserved share.
