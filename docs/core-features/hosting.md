# Hosting

## Self-Hosted

`zrok` is not limited to a managed offering. You can host your own version of `zrok` as well and there's [a self-hosting guide](../guides/v0.3_self_hosting_guide.md). `zrok` is
also freely available as open source software hosted by GitHub under a very permissive Apache v2 license.

## Managed Service

`zrok` is also offered as a cloud service, making it instantly accessible to a large population immediately.
NetFoundry provides a manged version of `zrok` at https://zrok.io. This provides the easy-to-use,
quick to demonstrate features of `zrok` without needing to deploy and host `zrok` yourself.
