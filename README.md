# zrok

`zrok` is a service designed to provide frictionless access to ephemeral, geo-scale reverse proxy capabilities.

![zrok overview](docs/images/zrok_v0.2_overview.png)

`zrok` is designed with the following properties:

## Frictionless

`zrok` is designed to provide a "frictionless" experience. A single binary and a single command is all that is required to enable ephemeral connectivity.

`zrok` works in a large number environments: developer shells, container sidecars, serverless environments, webhooks.

## Expand with OpenZiti

`zrok` is built on top of OpenZiti, a next-generation solution for secure application connectivity. `zrok` is a fantastic way to start working with OpenZiti. Start with simple `zrok` ephemeral connectivity, and then layer on additional capabilities provided by the underlying OpenZiti network.

Bring `zrok` into your existing OpenZiti deployment to provide rapid, ephemeral connectivity for a number of important HTTP scenarios.

## World-Scale

`zrok` is the software that powers the `zrok.io` service. It is designed to scale as large as you want.

## Multiple Isolated Tenants

A single `zrok` instance can support any number of isolated tenants, allowing them to coexist on top of the same OpenZiti deployment in a secure manner.

## Self-hosting Capable

Install `zrok` on top of your own OpenZiti network. `zrok` is simple to operate and scale.
